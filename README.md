# Spring Boot

Spring Boot is an open source Java-based framework used to create a micro Service. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration. Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

This is a sample project of using Spring Boot to develop backend RESTful API function.
